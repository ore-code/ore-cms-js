Overview
=====================================================

Ore DB is a refreshingly simple content management system
designed for teams who value clarity, speed, and control. 
Whether you're a developer building out a site structure 
or a content editor updating pages, Ore CMS makes 
collaboration seamless—without the overhead of traditional 
CMS platforms.

At its core, Ore CMS is a client-side CMS. That means 
there’s no backend, no database, and no server-side logic. 
Everything runs in the browser, powered by static files 
and a few smart conventions. You drop it onto any server 
that supports rewrite rules, and you're off to the races.

But don’t let its simplicity fool you. Ore CMS is built 
around a powerful idea: separation of concerns. Content
lives in Markdown files. Layouts are defined by HTML 
templates. And if you want to add interactivity, just 
create a JavaScript file with the same name as your 
Markdown page—ore-cms will automatically inject it when
 the page loads. This clean separation means content 
 editors never have to touch code, and developers never 
 have to worry about breaking content.

There’s no admin dashboard. No login screen. Permissions
are handled at the operating system level, so you control
access using standard file permissions. Want to give someone
edit access? Just give them write access to the folder. 
Want to lock things down? Remove it. It’s that simple.
