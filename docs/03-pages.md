Pages
===========================================================

All pages must be placed inside the `public` folder and organized into subfolders. This structure keeps content properly routed and ensures the CMS can display each page correctly.

**Example**

	/
	├── public/
	│   ├── main/
	│   │   ├── home.md
	│   │   ├── story.md
	│   │   └── contact.md	
	│   ├── menus/		
	│   │   ├── coffee.md
	│   │   └── pastries.md		
	├── default.html

Writing Pages
-----------------------------------------------------------

Markdown is a plain text format used to create your webpages. It supports basic structure like headings, lists, and links. Files written in Markdown use the `.md` extension and are automatically displayed as formatted pages by the CMS.

	About
	=======================================================

	Our coffee house began as a quiet idea between two friends who loved early mornings and long conversations. Tucked into a narrow brick storefront on a sleepy street, it opened with just a few tables, a hand-painted sign, and a promise to serve coffee that felt like home. Word spread slowly, then all at once — artists, students, and neighbors started showing up not just for the drinks, but for the warmth. Over time, the space grew into a local fixture, known for its handwritten menus, mismatched chairs, and the smell of fresh espresso drifting out onto the sidewalk.

	Beans
	-------------------------------------------------------

	The beans come from a small cooperative in the highlands of Guatemala, where volcanic soil and cool nights produce a rich, balanced flavor. Each batch is roasted locally in small quantities to preserve its character — smooth, slightly nutty, with hints of dark chocolate and citrus. The coffee house chose these beans for their distinctive taste and consistency, offering a cup that’s bold, comforting, and unmistakably theirs.

Text Editors
-----------------------------------------------------------

You can edit Markdown files with any text editor. While all editors support plain text, some offer features that make writing and organizing Markdown easier—especially if you're working on multiple pages or updating content regularly. Use 
whatever tool fits your workflow best.
